This pipeline uses a syntenic cg-alignment of Rleguminosarum.

It concatenates the syntenic core genes in bins of a given size. Then it infers recombination with the Kussell-lab mcorr-package which is based on coalescent theory with recombination.


This pipeline will be expanded such that it also uses PHI for the concatenated bins.
