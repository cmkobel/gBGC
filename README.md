#### Investigating GC-Biased Gene Conversion (gBGC) in Rhizobium leguminosarum

I'm developing a number of pipelines that I use to utilize different software in order to measure recombination in bacteria. In order to validate my results, I relate the results of each pipeline.

1. workflow_reads maps reads to a manually picked reference. Recombination is then inferred on the cg-alignment or each gene in the reference.
1. workflow_assemblyalignmentgenerator uses the pipeline developed by kussell-lab.
1. workflow_mcorr uses syntenic cg-alignments. Specifically for Rleguminosarum
1. workflow_PHI uses Bruen's recombination inference tool.




# Log
I want to investigate the relationship between recombination-rate and GC3 content. I found a new method for inferring recombination rate in bacteria [kussell-lab/mcorr](https://github.com/kussell-lab/mcorr) and wanted to use it to indirectly replicate [Lassalle et al. 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004941). In this study they use [PHI](https://www.maths.otago.ac.nz/~dbryant/software.html) which I will come back around later. The GC3 content is easy to measure. Just align the reading frame, and count the proportion of G's and C's on every third position.

I wanted to have a strong signal, so I chose the species with the strongest known relation. In Lassalle et al. 2015 they show that a linear relationship between recombination and GC3 has an R^2 = .68 for Streptococcus pyogenes. Thus I randomly selected ~60 S. pyogenes genomes from genbank, aligned the core genomes and measured the recombination for each gene. When I use kussell-lab/mcorr, I get the following results:

_**Figure 1**: Recombination rate inferred from the core genes of 64 randomly selected S. pyogenes genomes from genbank shown against the GC3 content of each gene. Relationship missing._

This figure shows that either there is no relationship, or something is wrong with the method. The problem is that mcorr most often infers that recombination is lacking (close to zero). 

As a measure to make Figure 1 more comparable to the main figure in Lassalle, I made 20 bins with an equal number of genes in each, and calculated median phi_pool:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmkobel/gBGC/master/log/1.2_Spyo_20_bins.png)
_**Figure 1.1**: Recombination rate inferred from the core genes of 64 randomly selected S. pyogenes genomes from genbank shown against the GC3 content of each gene. 20 bins. Relationship is negative at best._


I think the problem is that even though there is recombination, it is hard to infer it from single genes. Recombination is measured using linkage-disequilibrium (LD). If the sequences are too short (average gene length 1000) means that there is not much LD to measure. If we concatenate syntenic genes and inferm recombination from these, we might have enough signal to actually measure recombination.

I found a dataset of core genes from 5 genospecies of Rhizobium leguminosarum. Other studies on this data suggests that the recombination/GC-bias should be existing in this dataset. I concatenated the genes in bins of different sizes, inferred recombination. The code for this pipeline can be found in [workflow/](https://github.com/cmkobel/gBGC/tree/master/workflow). These are the results I got.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmkobel/gBGC/master/log/2_Rleg_phi_pool_all.png)
_**Figure2**: Recombination rate against GC3 content for concatenated core genes of size 20K._

As we can see, again, there is no relationship between the GC3-content and recombination rate. Maybe there is a relationship for genospecies D, bin size 20000. But only if you remove all the points in the bottom.

I tried removing the tails of the distribution, but this doesn't help on the relationship. I'm starting to think that either something is wrong with this method, or I'm using it wrong. As a sanity check, in order the check if there is a relationship in this data or not, using a method that we know works (PHI in Lassalle et al. 2015), we can check that the data we're feeding into mcorr actually has a signal.

I ran PHI for each gene in the core genome of these 5 genospecies of R. leguminosarum. The pipeline for this can be found at [workflow_PHI/](https://github.com/cmkobel/gBGC/tree/master/workflow_PHI), and these are the results I got:

![](https://github.com/cmkobel/gBGC/blob/master/log/3_PHI_ratio.png)

_**Figure 3**: 20 bins with an equal number of genes in each. mean_GC3 is the mean GC3 content in that bin and ratio is the number of significantly recombining genes over the total number of genes in the bin. Significance of recombination is inferred with PHI._

Finally we get a strong signal. The R^2 are somewhat high. I think they are low for some of the genospecies because of a limited sample size. The sample sizes for each genospecies (R. leguminosarum) are as follows:

| genospecies | # isolates |
| ----------- | ----------:|
| A           |  32        | 
| B           |  32        | 
| C           |  116       |  
| D           |  5         |
| E           |  11        | 


At this point we know that the data is OK. Thus, something must be wrong with the way we apply the mcorr recombination inference tool.

I wanted to compare the results of mcorr and PHI, but here two problems arise. 1 PHI calculates p-values and mcorr calculates recombination rates. These are very differently distributed, and hard to compare. Nevertheless, here are the results:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmkobel/gBGC/master/log/4_main_compare_logphipool_phinormal_free.png)
_**Figure 4**: Comparison of the recombination rate (mcorr) and p-value of test for recombination (PHI) when the core genome genes are concatenated into 20K bins._
This pretty much shows what we have been looking at all the time: That there is no relationship between what the two tests (mcorr and PHI) measure on the same data.

I discovered a new problem: The distribution of p-values looks weird when it operates on concatenated genes:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmkobel/gBGC/master/log/5_dont_concat_genes.png "This is what I call false positives")

_**Figure 5**: Distribution of p-values for the PHI-test of recombination when the genes are concatenated into 20K long bins._

Well, that tells us that we should definitely not concatenat the genes before putting them into PHI, or any other statistical program for that matter - that is - if we trust PHI's p-values.

Now we can completely ditch the workflow/ directory. Let's compare mcorr and PHI on non-concatenated genes. This can easily be done by setting the bin size to minus infinity, or just 1. So maybe I don't have ditch the pipeline completely, just don't use the bin_size variable.

## Comparing mcorr and PHI without concatenating the genes.
I inferred recombination in the genes without concatenating them. This means that we have a lot more points, with greater variance. We already know from initial analyses that mcorr is not able to expose a possible relationship between recombination rate nad GC3-content. But we know that PHI can (Fig. 3).

Before I'm showing the comparison, I want to show the distribution of p-values for PHI. It still looks a bit weird to me (not uniform), but it looks a lot better than before (Fig. 5).

_**Figure 6**: Distribution of p-values for the PHI-test of recombination when the genes are not concatenated. (To be honest; I don't think these distributions look nice. Too polarized.)_

And here is the comparison between the two methods:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmkobel/gBGC/master/log/7_main_compare_logphipool_phinormal_free.png)
_**Figure 7**: Comparison of the recombination rate (mcorr) and p-value of test for recombination (PHI) when the core genome genes are not concatenated._

I don't know what to think of this. I don't see any relationship. 
My conclusion is to ditch the mcorr test completely. Maybe I will go a bit into its theory, but I don't want to base any generality test on it.


## Relating to ClonalFrame

I will run [ClonalFrameML](https://github.com/xavierdidelot/ClonalFrameML) on the R. legum data to see if it can be used for comparison instead.

TODO: run ClonalFrameML on the R. legum data, compare it to PHI and discuss the results.
TODO: understand the theory behind mcorr, PHI and ClonalFrame
